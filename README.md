# Javascript_Assessment
What did you like about this project?
- I think this project itself made myself recall back on what we have learnt so far in this course.

- It's a great way to see if our understanding of all the functions we have learnt so far.

- Its challenging but fun.


What did you struggle with in this project?

I did  in a manner that made me in a loop over and over again because I forgot to go steps by steps in plain english to fulfill the criteria needed

I jump around too many parts to even understand the project and code it.



What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I will have done it over again by reading it from top to the bottom then start coding.

I realized if I go all over the place I could not understand the feature at all.

Great Learning process.
